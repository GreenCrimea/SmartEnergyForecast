There are currently some known bugs in this verison, such as the plot type resettings after every settings change, and some matplotlib elements overlapping. While these bugs could be fixed with more time investment, this project was meant only as a hobby endeavour, and thus has only been completed to a minimum viable level, as a proof of concept. The code also contains very little comments or docstrings, and the nature of the interlinked objects all accessing eachothers attributes may make it hard to decipher how the program is operating.
